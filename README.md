# Project-1-weather-app

# Description 
> User can search for any city and get the weather (wind speed and temperature). User also has the option to change the degrees from fahrenheit to celcius and vice versa. 
<hr>

# How to use the app
> Type in the city name, click search and and view the weather. 
> Click on the degrees button to toggle it from fahrenheit to celcius and vice versa. 
> Click the "delete" button to remove that city.
<hr>

# Code goals
> The index.js file will have 4 event listeners and one function. 
> One should change the city in the api to match the city typed into the text input.
> The second one should submit the city typed into the seach bar without reloading the page.
> The third one should allow us to change the degrees fahrenheit to degrees celcius and vice versa.
> The fourth one should allow us to remove the entire city with all of its info when clicked.
> Write a fetch request that also calls a function that allows us to see the cities that were submitted.
<hr>

# Conclusion
> We created 4 event listeners and a function, as well as html and css files, and now we have a full blown program that can be used by any user in the world to view the current weather.
